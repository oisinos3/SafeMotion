This is the project repository for all documentation, assets, information, and tutorials on the **SafeMotion project**. The project utilizes **OptiTrack motion capture** to help visualize safety procedures and the effects of unsafe manual handling.

The repository is actively maintained and serves as a central hub for all project resources.

### **üé¨ Export & Workflow Best Practices**

### **For Better Exports - no Addons or Post-Processing required**

* **Skeletal Mesh Option:** When exporting your data, ensure the "Skeletal Mesh" option is enabled for both the **Rigidbodies** and the **Skeletons**. This is crucial for them to be recognized and imported correctly into Unreal Engine.

### **For Best Practice & Accurate Matching**

* **Mark Pivot Points:** In Motive, make a note of or physically mark the pivot point of each rigid body. This ensures we know its exact location, for accurate alignment when placing and parenting objects in Unreal.
* **Mark the Floor Point:** Mark and export the floor point from thr Motive capture. This provides a consistent reference for the ground plane, helping to align your entire scene correctly in Unreal Engine.
* **Collect Reference Footage:** As you record your motion capture data, simultaneously capture reference footage to be sure the captured data is accurate, and can help match rigidbodies etc.
