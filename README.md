### **üé¨ Export & Workflow Best Practices**

### **For Better Exports - no Addons or Post-Processing required**

* **Skeletal Mesh Option:** When exporting your data, ensure the "Skeletal Mesh" option is enabled for both the **Rigidbodies** and the **Skeletons**. This is crucial for them to be recognized and imported correctly into Unreal Engine.

### **For Best Practice & Accurate Matching**

* **Mark Pivot Points:** In Motive, make a note of or physically mark the pivot point of each rigid body. This ensures you know its exact location, which is vital for accurate alignment when placing and parenting objects in Unreal.
* **Mark the Floor Point:** Mark and export the floor point from your Motive capture. This provides a consistent reference for the ground plane, helping to align your entire scene correctly in Unreal Engine.
* **Collect Reference Footage:** As you record your motion capture data, simultaneously capture reference footage. This video serves as a valuable tool for quality assurance, troubleshooting, and verifying the accuracy of your animation in post-production.
