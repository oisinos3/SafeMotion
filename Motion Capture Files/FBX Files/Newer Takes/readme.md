The "RigidBodies_Only" files, have no human skeletons or skeletal meshes, and only show rigidbodies - they must be processed through the Blender addon in order to be read by Unreal, as they don't have a skeletal mesh/armature attached.

The "Box_Handoff" files are the opposite - there is no rigidbodies included, as it was a take with only Julian and myself handing the boxes between each other to test two suits interacting in the system.

The rest of the files contain skeletons, and rigidbody empties that must be processed through Blender before being read into Unreal.
